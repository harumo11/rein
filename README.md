## *This library is under heavy development.*

## Introduction
Creating the extreamly simple and easy library is our target.

### 0. The feature list of the library.

- A lot of documentation.
Unlike another C++ library, librein has a lot of docmentation.

- Easy API.
librein's API is made as easy as possible.

### 1. The implimention list of algorithm.
We prefer "some simple API of algorithm with rich documentation" to "a lot of dirty API of algorithm with little documentation.


**Dynamic Programing**
- value iteration

**Montecalro**
- Not yet

**TD**
- Q learning(Table)
- sarsa(Table)

### 2. Future work and road map
It's here

## Help me
We think any opinion, issue and question has worth.

If you get any opinions, issues and questions, please feel free to coutact us using issue on github.

We want your opinion, issue, question, even if you are begginer of reinforcement learning, C++ program, and github.

## Start librein in 30 [sec]
